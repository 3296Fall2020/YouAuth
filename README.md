### Matthew, 45
>Matthew, age 45, is a software developer in Utah. He stays up to date on the latest technological advancements and has an interest in AI. Matthew specializes in sales and primarily distributes tracking software. Most of his clients are older, small to medium-sized business owners, who don’t use the internet often. He’s found that a majority of his clients have trouble recalling their passwords and often have poor password security. He decides that YouAuth is a good alternative to traditional password authentication. YouAuth provides his clients with the ability to use new facial recognition services and no longer worry about password management during day-to-day operations.
