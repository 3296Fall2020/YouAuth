## Project Vision
For companies, campuses, and other larger organizations/corporations who need better and more efficient security for their websites. YouAuth will be a node module that can be seamlessly integrated into websites to provide facial recognition functionality through use of the open source computer vision library, OpenCV. YouAuth can either replace the use of usernames/passwords, or be added as an extra layer of authenication.

What puts YouAuth in a different position than standard login systems is that it uses biometrics, a ever increasingly popular way of identifying individuals based off their biological features. Unlike similar security services like FaceID, YouAuth will not be device specific, and can be cross platform as necessary for platforms that support running web applications.

## Features

* Image caputure
* Image training with OpenCV
* Secure data storage

## Persona

### Name
>Persona


### Matthew, 45
>Matthew, age 45, is a software developer in Utah. He stays up to date on the latest technological advancements and has an interest in AI. Matthew specializes in sales and primarily distributes tracking software. Most of his clients are older, small to medium-sized business owners, who don’t use the internet often. He’s found that a majority of his clients have trouble recalling their passwords and often have poor password security. He decides that YouAuth is a good alternative to traditional password authentication. YouAuth provides his clients with the ability to use new facial recognition services and no longer worry about password management during day-to-day operations.

### Steve, 35
>Steve, age 35, is a technical support specialist at a Bank in Miami, Florida located in neighborhood with a large elderly demographic. Steve graduated with a IT degree and has spent 10 years as a tech support. Over the course of his career, he primarily focused on dealing with website security. His current work involves improving the login system on the Bank website because many of their bank clients aren't very tech savvy. 
>
>Steve has found out over the years that the main security vulnerability is the use of weak passwords. He has received on average, ten calls a month about a account being stolen. When talking with the clients, he found out that they didn't like having long and complex passwords because they were difficult to remember. Recommending something like a password manager was also too tedious for some because they didn't feel safe storing all their passwords in one place. YouAuth will allow bank clients to log in using their face as a extra authenticator, and is easy to use with just a webcam.

### Jacob, 28
>Jacob is white collar worker in Philadelphia and he suffers from dyslexia. He commutes to work everyday on the train where he works for Comcast in their media department.
Throughout the day, Jacob has to log on and off websites, some of which are work-related, and others of which are personal. 
The websites he uses include email, social media sites, entertainment sites such as YouTube, and business websites for work. 
Logging into these websites can take a long time and be very frustrating because of his dyslexia. 
If Jacob had access to YouAuth, the facial recognition software would help him log into
these website securely and quickly without having to struggle to enter in long, complicated passwords. 
Not only would this save Jacob time at work but it would also help him avoid unwarranted frustration.
